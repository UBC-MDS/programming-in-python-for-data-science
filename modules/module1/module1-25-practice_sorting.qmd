# 9.1. Exercises

## Practice Sorting

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time, could take a bit of time for everything to load. Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run it and see if you obtain the desired output. Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

```{pyodide}
import pandas as pd

# The data
hockey_players = pd.read_csv('data/canucks.csv')
hockey_players
```

Let's sort our hockey dataframe.

**Tasks:**

- Sort your `hockey_players` dataframe by Salary from most to least and name your new dataframe as `rich_players`.
- Display it.

```{pyodide}
#| setup: true
#| exercise: practice_sorting
import pandas as pd
from src.utils import print_correct_msg

hockey_players = pd.read_csv('data/canucks.csv')
```

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: practice_sorting
# Sort the hockey_player dataframe by salary in descending order    
# Save it with the name rich_players
____ = ____.____(____, ____)

# Display it
____
```

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: practice_sorting
#| check: true
solution = hockey_players.sort_values(by='Salary', ascending=False)
assert isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame), "The result should be a DataFrame."
assert solution.shape == result.shape, "Your dataframe has the wrong dimensions."
assert list(solution.columns) == list(result.columns), "Your columns do not seem to be correct."
assert list(solution.index) == list(result.index), "Did you order in descending order?"
print_correct_msg()
```

:::: { .hint exercise="practice_sorting" }
::: { .callout-note collapse="false" }

## Hint 1

- Are you sure you are using `sort_values`?
- Are you using the argument `ascending=False` to order `Salary` in descending order?

:::: { .solution exercise="practice_sorting" }
::: { .callout-tip collapse="false" }

## Fully worked solution:

```{pyodide}
# Sort the hockey_player dataframe by salary in descending order    
# Save it with the name rich_players
rich_players = hockey_players.sort_values(by='Salary', ascending=False)

# Display it
rich_players
```
