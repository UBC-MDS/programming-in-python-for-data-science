# 7.1. Exercises

## Practicing Selecting

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time, could take a bit of time for everything to load. Be patient, it could take a few minutes.   

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run it and see if you obtain the desired output. Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

```{pyodide}
import pandas as pd

# The data
hockey_players = pd.read_csv('data/canucks.csv')
hockey_players
```

Let's try selecting a specific column.

**Tasks:**

- Select all the rows from column `Salary` only and save it as `player_cost`. (_Hint: you don't need `.loc[]` here_)
- Display it.


```{pyodide}
#| setup: true
#| exercise: practicing_selecting
import pandas as pd
from src.utils import print_correct_msg

hockey_players = pd.read_csv('data/canucks.csv')
```

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: practicing_selecting
# Select all the rows from column Salary only 
# Save it as player_cost
# (Hint: you don't need loc here) 
____ = ____

# Display it
____ 
```

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: practicing_selecting
#| check: true
solution = hockey_players[['Salary']]
assert isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame), "The result should be a DataFrame."
assert solution.sum()[0] == result.sum()[0], "Did you create player_cost properly?"
print_correct_msg()
```

:::: { .hint exercise="practicing_selecting" }
::: { .callout-note collapse="false" }

## Hint 1

- Are you using the correct dataframe labels?
- Are you using double `[]` brackets?
- Are you using "quotations"?

::::

:::: { .solution exercise="practicing_selecting" }
::: { .callout-tip collapse="false" }

## Fully worked solution:

```{pyodide}
# Select all the rows from column Salary only 
# Save it as player_cost 
# (Hint: you don't need loc here) 
player_cost = hockey_players[['Salary']]

# Display it
player_cost
```
