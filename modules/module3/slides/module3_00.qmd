## Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, students are expected to:

- Explain what tidy data is.
- Use [`.melt()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.melt.html) and [`.pivot()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pivot.html) to reshape dataframes, specifically to make tidy data.
- Learn how to reset a dataframe's index.
- Combine dataframes using [`.merge()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html) and [`.concat()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html) and know when to use these different methods.
- Understand the different joining methods.
