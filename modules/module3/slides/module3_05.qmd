We have some data obtain from the resource available <a href="https://github.com/jvcasillas/untidydata#language_diversity" target="_blank">here</a>.

<br>

![](../../../static/module3/wide-long1.png){width="60%" fig-alt="404 iamge" fig-align="center"}

<br>

This shows the language diversity within different countries as well as their population and area.


:::{.notes}
In the last section we learned about tidy data and how it is determined based on what we are trying to figure out, eg: what our statistical question is.

There are cases where a longer dataframe is considered tidy data and in other cases, a wider dataframe is tidy depending on what is being ask. 

Let's explore some more examples.

![](../../../static/module3/wide-long1.png){width="40%" fig-alt="404 image" fig-align="center"}

We are trying to answer the statistical question:    

***"What factors are associated with language diversity (as measured by the number of languages spoken in a country)?"***

![](../../../static/module3/wide-long2.png){width="40%" fig-alt="404 image" fig-align="center"}

We are trying to answer the statistical question:

***"What factors are associated with language diversity (as measured by the number of languages spoken in a country)?"***

In this case, it makes the most sense for our data to have the measurements `area` and `population` as variables that may or may not affect language diversity. This would be considered tidy data and it is stored as a wider dataframe than what was initially presented to us.

UNICEF dataset on under-five child mortality available <a href="https://sejdemyr.github.io/data-vis/mortality-wealth-time/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Let's look at another example.

Here is the UNICEF dataset on under-five child mortality  which is available <a href="https://sejdemyr.github.io/data-vis/mortality-wealth-time/" target="_blank">here</a>. It is based on data that can be found at [www.childmortality.org](www.childmortality.org). The under-five mortality rate is expressed as the number of under-five deaths per 1,000 live births.

![](../../../static/module3/wide-long3.png){width="40%" fig-alt="404 image" fig-align="center"}

The statistical question that we'd like to answer with this data set is:

***"Is there a relationship between country and/or year of under-five child mortality?"***

![](../../../static/module3/wide-long4.png){width="40%" fig-alt="404 image" fig-align="center"}


:::{.notes}
The statistical question that we'd like to answer with this data set is:

***"Is there a relationship between country and/or year of under-five child mortality?"***. 

We are interested in the variable `year`. Having a single variable for year would be the most appropriate to use in this analysis and display tidy data. This would correspond to a long dataframe.

At this point you may be asking yourself the question _"Are there any verbs, that would easily transform data into longer or wider dataframes?"_

If you are, then you are ahead of the game!  We will discuss this in the next section.
