**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_
