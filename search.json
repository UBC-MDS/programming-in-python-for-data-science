The same applies here, however, the concept of tidy data stems from a paper written by renowned data scientist Hadley Wickham in 2014.\nWe tidy our data in such a way so that we can create a standard across multiple analysis tools. It changes the focus from figuring out the logistics of how the data is structured, to answering the actual analysis question being asked.\nThis approach allows us to standardize input arguments of certain analysis verbs like .describe() and other predictive methods."

During the course, you will work with powerful Python packages made for data-science, including Pandas for processing tabular data, Altair for data visualization and NumPy for working with numerical data types.\nYou will also learn about iteration, flow control, and the data types relevant to data exploration and analysis. You will leave this course capable of processing raw data into a format suitable for analysis, writing your own analysis functions, and deriving data-driven insights via the creation of interactive visualizations and summary tables.\nCourse prerequisites: None",

This is different than a regular csv file as an Excel file can contain many different sheets and can be formatted uniquely and specifically for an individual’s needs.\n\nOf course, there are many other file types but we will focus on these for this course."

This will enable us to see the various values of calories and how many times they occur.\nTo make a histogram, we use mark_bar().\nIn the encode() verb, we specify the x-axis as calories and use the argument bin=True.

In short, hard coding is a breeding ground for bugs.\nRemember our function squares_a_list()?\nIn this function, we “hard-coded” in 2 when we calculated number ** 2.\nThere are a couple of approaches to improving the situation. One is to assign 2 to a variable in the function before doing this calculation. That way, if you need to reuse that number, later on, you can just refer to the variable; and if you need to change the 2 to a 3, you only need to change it in one place. Another benefit is that you’re giving it a variable name, which acts as a little bit of documentation.\nThe other approach is to turn the value into an argument like we did when we made exponent_a_list().\nThis new function now gives us more flexibility with our code.\nIf we now encounter a situation where we need to calculate each element to a different exponent like 4 or 0, we can do so without writing new code and potentially making a new error in doing so.\nWe reduce our long term workload.\nThis version is more maintainable code, but it doesn’t give the function caller any flexibility. What you decide depends on how you expect your function to be used."

For example, what if we don’t want the plot? Perhaps the plot is just something we wanted a single time, and now we are committed to it for each time we use the function.\nAnother problem with this function is that the means are only printed and not returned. Thus, we have no way of accessing the statistics to use further in our code (we would have to repeat ourselves and rewrite it)."
