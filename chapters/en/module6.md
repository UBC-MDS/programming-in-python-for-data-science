**Question 1**      

Given the code below, what is the output?

```python

toy = "ball"

def playtime():
    toy = "truck"
    return toy 

toy
```

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="<code>ball</code>" correct="true">

Well done!

</opt>

<opt text="<code>truck</code>">

Since `toy` is being called in the global environment, the output of `toy` is the value of the global variable value of  `toy`.

</opt>

<opt text="<code>Error</code>">

This will still run without an error!

</opt>

</choice> 

**Question 2**          

Given the code below, what is the output? 

```python

toy = "ball"

def playtime():
    toy = "truck"
    return toy 

playtime()
```

<choice id="2" >
<opt text="<code>ball</code>" >

`toy` is equal to `"truck"` in the local environment so it will return the local variable value of `toy`. 

</opt>

<opt text="<code>truck</code>"  correct="true">

Nice job!

</opt>

<opt text="<code>Error</code>">

This will still run without an error!

</opt>

**Question 3**          

Given the code below what is the output?

```python
def playtime():
    toy = "truck"
    return toy 

toy
```

<choice id="3" >
<opt text="<code>None</code>" >

`toy` is a local variable, will it be recognized in a global environment?

</opt>

<opt text="<code>truck</code>">

`toy` is a local variable, will it be recognized in a global environment?

<exercise id="3" title="Side Effects">

**Question 1**      

***True or False***        
Side effects make your code easier to debug.



<choice id="1" >
<opt text="True" >

Ahh! Please go back and read over the slides. Side effects are generally avoided.

</opt>

<opt text="False" correct="true">

Well done. This is an important one to get right! 

</opt>

</choice> 

**Question 2**          

Which of the following functions produce a side effect? 

A) 
```python

toy = "ball"

def playtime():
    toy = "truck"
    print(toy) 

playtime()
```

B) 

```python

toy = "ball"

def playtime():
    toy = "truck"
    return toy 

playtime()
```

<choice id="2" >

<opt text="A"  correct="true">

Nice job!

</opt>

<opt text="B" >

Printing `toy` is considered a function side effect! 

</opt>

<opt text="A and B"  >

Having a function `return` something is not considered necessarily a side effect. 

</opt>


<opt text="Neither A or B"  >

Printing `toy` is considered a function side effect! 

</opt>

</choice>  

**Question 3** 

***True of False***      
If a function modifies a variable in the function's local environment, that is considered a side effect.

<choice id="3" >
<opt text="True">

This is not considered a side effect if a variable created within a function is modified within the same function. 

</opt>

<opt text="False"  correct="true">

 Perfect!

<exercise id="4" title= "Writing Functions Without Side Effects">

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load. Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

The function `kg_to_lb()` is used to convert a list of elements with kg units into a list of elements with lbs units. Unfortunate this function includes a side effect that edits one of the global variables. 


Tasks:
- Write a new function named `better_kg_to_lb` that no longer contains a side effect.
- Test your new function on the `weight_kg` list and save the results in an object named `weight_lb_again`.



<codeblock id="06_04">

- Are you putting `weight_lb` inside the function now? 
- Are you returning `weight_lb`?

<exercise id="6" title="Will it Output?">

Given the following function, which of the function calls will result in an error? 

```python
def name_initials(first_name, last_name, year_of_birth = None):
    if year_of_birth is not None: 
        initials = first_name[0].upper() + middle_name[0].upper() + str(year_of_birth)

    return initials
```


<choice id="1" >
<opt text="<code>name_initials('Cameron', 'Grant')</code>" >

This one will run since `year_of_birth` is optional and will default to `None`. The output is `CG`. 

</opt>

<opt text="<code>name_initials(last_name = 'Grant', year_of_birth = 1977, first_name = 'Cameron')</code>">

Since we are defining our arguments with their names and values, this one will result in an output of `CG1987`.

</opt>

<opt text="<code>name_initials('Cameron', 1977, 'Grant')</code>"  correct="true">

This will result in an error since the argument values are not in the defined order and they are not defined with the argument names. 

</opt>

This function calls the arguments in the same order they were defined in. The output is `CG1987`.

<exercise id="7" title="Default Arguments">

**Question 1**    

Given the function below: 
```python
def employee_wage(employee_id, position, experience = 3):
    if position == "doctor": 
        wage = 150000
    elif position == "teacher":

What is the approximate wage of employee `765` who is a lawyer? 


<choice id="1" >
<opt text="<code>100000</code>" >

Are you taking a close look at the argument `experience` which has a default value?

**Question 2**  

If I make a function call using the following code, and I know that that parameter `spice_level` is an argument that has a default value, which other arguments **MUST** also have set default values? 

```
menu_item_id = 42
menu_item_name = "Green Curry"
spice_level = "Medium"
meat = "Tofu"
rice = True

thai_food(menu_item_id, menu_item_name, spice_level, meat, rice)

<choice id="2" >

<opt text="<code>menu_item_id</code> and <code>menu_item_name</code>" >

These two arguments can be either required or default arguments.

<opt text="<code>meat</code>">

This is partially right but not entirely.

</opt>

<opt text="<code>rice</code>">

This is partially right but not entirely.

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes.

**Weight** and **mass** are 2 very different measurements, although they are used interchangeably in everyday conversations. 
**Mass** is defined by  <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/591747main_MVW_Intro.pdf" target="_blank">NASA</a> as the amount of matter in an object, whereas, **weight** is defined as the vertical force exerted by a mass as a result of gravity (with units of Newtons). 
The function `earth_weight()` converts an object's mass to Weight by multiplying it by the gravitational force acting on it. On Earth, the gravitational force is measured as 9.8 $m/s^2$.  


We want to make a more versatile function by having the ability to calculate the Weight of any object on any particular planet and not just Earth. Redefine the function `earth_weight()` to take an argument with a default gravitational force of 9.8.  


Tasks:
- Create a new function named `mass_to_weight` and give it an additional argument named  `g,` which has a default value of 9.8.
- Test your new function by converting the mass of 76 kg to weight on Earth and save the results in an object named `earth_weight`.
- Test your function again but this time, calculate the weight of the 76 kg object on the moon using a gravitational force of 1.62 m/s^2 and save your function call to an object named `moon_weight`.




<codeblock id="06_08">

- Are you putting `g=9.8` inside the function named `mass_to_weight`? 
- Are you calling `mass_to_weight(76)` and saving it in an object named `earth_weight`? 
- Are you calling `mass_to_weight(76, 1.62)` and saving it in an object named `moon_weight`?

The first step in a systematic approach to program design is: 


<choice id="3" >
<opt text="Write unit tests."  >

But we don't know our input arguments or the output type that we are expecting yet?

</opt>

<opt text="Write a docstring." >

This is the last step!

</opt>

<opt text="Write a function stub." correct="true" >

Nailed it!

</opt>

<opt text="Write your pseudo-code."  >

This should come after writing tests and defining your function!

<exercise id="21" title= "Writing Tests">

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

Given our BMI function from the previous few questions, let's write some unit tests.

Tasks:
- Write at least 4 unit tests and check that at least 2 of them are testing edge cases. 
- For this exercsie, use single quotes `''` instead of double quotes `""` for the `assert` messages.


<codeblock id="06_21">

- Are you using `Assert` statements?
- Are you checking that they equal a correct value?

<exercise id="23" title="Function Design Questions">

What's wrong with the function below? 

```python
def give_me_facts(myinfo):
    max_val = max(myinfo)
    min_val = min(myinfo)
    range_val = max_val - min_val
    return max_val, min_val, range_val
```


<choice id="1" >
<opt text="It is doing too many calculations" >

Calculations are fine if we need them and here it looks like we need them to calculate the range.

</opt>

<opt text="It is using a global variable inside the function" >

There are no global variables in the function.

</opt>

<opt text="It's returning too many objects" correct="true">

Perfect! This is too many!

</opt>

<opt text="It's hard coding values in the function"  >

We are lucky that there are no hardcoded values in this function!

</opt>

<exercise id="24" title="Improve it!">

How can we improve this function?

```python

def count_the_sevens(mylist): 
    number_of_occurances  = mylist.count(7)
    return number_of_occurances
```


<choice id="1" >
<opt text="Avoid using a list as an input arguments" >

Lists are completely fine to use as input arguments. 

</opt>

<opt text="Simplify the operations" >

This function is only 3 lines! Do we need it simpler?

</opt>

<opt text="Use fewer global variables" >

Luckily no global variables are being used in this function.

</opt>

<opt text="Remove the hard-coded value"  correct="true">

Perfect! Let's make the count variable (in this case the `7`) an input argument. 

</opt>

Given the function below, improve it so that it follows good function design principles. 


Tasks:
- Given the function above, improve it using to the new function `new_wage()`. We have provided you with the function stub and the docstring to guide you.   
- Make sure it follows good function design practices by not looping over a function, avoiding hard-coding and not returning multiple values.
- Test your new function on a person with a salary of $84000 and an expected raise of 12%.
- Save this in an object named `person1_new_wage`.


<codeblock id="06_25">

- Are you removing the hardcoded values in the function?
- Are removing the return of 2 variables? 
- Are you removing the loop from inside the function? 
- Are you multiplying the `salary` by `(1 + (0.01 * percent_raise)` ?
