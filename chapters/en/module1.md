**Question 1**          
What are dataframes comparable to?


<choice id="1" >
<opt text="Text Documents">

Is this an easy way to organize data?

</opt>

<opt text="Excel Sheets" correct="true">

Good job!

<opt text="Picture Frames" >

Are we storing pictures in a dataframe?

**Question 2**         
If a `csv` file was opened in a plain text editor, what character would be separating the values of each column? 

<choice id="2">
<opt text='<code> : </code>'>

The "C" in `csv` does not stand for colon. 

</opt>

<opt text='<code> ; </code>'>

 `csv` is an acronym for _______ Separated Values format, so likely not "Semi-Colon".

**Question 1**    
If you wanted only the rows from `cantaloupe` to  `kiwi`, what would your code look like using index labels?

<choice id="1" >

This is almost right but it may be good to check your columns.

This is almost right but it's missing something important! Try looking at the title of the slides we just finished.

**Question**    
If I wanted to make a tropical salad and the recipe calls for `kiwi`, `cantaloupe` and `guava` in this order and I am only interested in columns ordered as `sweetness`, `weight`, `seed` and  `location`, what would my code look like?

Unfortunately, this code has many errors in it.

The way that the rows and columns are separated may need to be looked over.

Yes, this looks right!

Let's sort our hockey dataframe.

Tasks:
- Sort your `hockey_players` dataframe by Salary from most to least and name your new dataframe as `rich_players`.
- Display it.


<codeblock id="01_25">

- Are you sure you are using `sort_values`?
- Are you using the argument `ascending=False` to order `Salary` in descending order?

Bringing back our Fruit Salad dataframe

**Question 1**

Which of the following columns contain numerical data?

<choice id="1" >
<opt text='<code>colour</code>, <code>shape</code>, <code>water-content</code>'>

Maybe it would be a good idea to take a look back at the slides again.

</opt>

<opt text='<code>colour</code>, <code>seed</code>, <code>water-content</code>, <code>weight</code>' >

Some of the columns maybe in here though!

</opt>

<opt text='<code>water-content</code>, <code>weight</code>' correct="true">

This looks great! Well done! 

</opt>

<opt text='All of the columns are categorical' >

Maybe it would be a good idea to take a look back at the slides again.

</opt>

</choice >


**Question 2**

We need summary statistics of both numerical and categorical columns of the dataframe `fruit_salad`. What code would be suitable for this?

<choice id="2" >
<opt text='<code>df.describe()</code>'>

Is our dataframe named `df`? Will this get summary statistics for all the columns?

</opt>

<opt text='<code>fruit_salad.describe()</code>' >

We want statistics of both quantitative and categorical columns.

</opt>

<opt text='<code>fruit_salad.describe(include="all")</code>' correct="true">

This looks great! Well done! 

</opt>

<opt text='<code>fruit_salad.summary(include="all")</code>' >

Is `summary` the correct command here?

</opt>

</choice >

Try to obtain some statistics from the hockey data.

Tasks:   
- Find the statistics of both categorical and quantitative columns. Save the dataframe in an object called `hockey_stats`.
- Display it.


<codeblock id="01_28a">

- Are you sure you are saving your objects correctly?
- Are you using using `.describe(include="all")` ?

Tasks:
- Find the total salary of the team and save it in an object called `player_cost`.

Let's get the frequencies of some of our values! We spoke in the slides about the steps we needed to follow to get a frequency table.  

Tasks:
- Let's make an object named `position_column` that consists of just the `Position` column. Note we will be using this for `value_counts` so we must do this with only using single `[]` brackets.
- Find the frequencies of the position for the hockey team using `.value_counts()` and save it as `position_freq`.
- Export `position_freq`  to a csv named `position_frequencies.csv` using `.to_csv()`.
- Don't forget to display it.

_If you get a warning along with your output, that's fine. We will explain why this happens further in the course._

- Are you sure you are using single `[]` brackets for `position_column`?

You are going to load the `canucks.csv` from the questions that we exported as a `csv` in the last section and create a `bar` plot of the `Positions` column.

Tasks:
- Load in the csv named `canucks.csv` and save it as `hockey_players`. 
- Use `alt.Chart()` to create a chart object.
- Use  `.mark_bar()` to create a bar plot.
- Use  `.encode()` to specify the `Position` column for plotting.
- Assign a color as Teal and set opacity to 0.5.
- Don't forget to add a title as "Canuck Player Positions"..

<codeblock id="01_32">

- Are you sure you are using `opacity` to set the opacity?
- Are you using the correct Dataframe?
- Did you assign the correct values to `color` and `opacity`?

Ok, let's try our luck with a scatterplot. We want to explore the relationship between `Age` and `Salary`.

Tasks:
- Plots x as `Age` and y as `Salary` using a scatterplot and save the plot in an object named `age_salary_scatter`.
- Use the `mark_circle(...)` to specify a scatter plot. 
- Set color to `Darkblue` and opacity to 0.4.
- Don't forget to assign a title as "Canuck players Age vs. Salary".
