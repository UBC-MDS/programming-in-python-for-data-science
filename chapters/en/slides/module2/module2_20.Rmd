Notes:

So far, we have accumulated many different skills to wrangle our data.  

One type of transformation that you may use often is replacing values within a column depending on a certain condition.  

Let's bring in a smaller version of our cereal dataset.

In the dataframe, the manufacturer value "Q" isn't that informative and it might be easier to understand our data if we change all these values to something more clear like "Quaker".

This leads us to our task:    

***Replace the `Q` manufacturer values with a new value of `Quaker`***

---


```{python}
cereal[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q'].assign(mfr = 'Quaker')
```




Notes: 

Our first instinct may be to first filter those rows using the technique we learned in our last section.  

From our new filtered selection, perhaps we could assign values of "Quaker" to column `mfr` using similar code this.

The output looks like it did what we wanted but what happened to the rest of our dataframe? 

Remember that we only want to replace the values in our existing dataframe and not create a new one. 

When we use the `.assign()` verb like this, it creates a new dataframe with only the rows that meet the condition ```cereal['mfr'] == 'Q'``` .  

This is problematic since we still want the original dataframe and the rows with `mfr` values not equal `Q`. 

So what do we do?

---

# Building on more things we know


```{python}
cereal.loc[73] 
```



```{python}
cereal.loc[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q']
```




Notes: 

Remember our friend `.loc[]`?  We are going to get reacquainted with it. 

Similarly, to how `.loc[]` can select and return specified columns and rows of the dataframe, it can filter on conditions too.    

We are used to seeing code involving `.loc[]` like this.

But we'll now get introduced to a new side of it when we use it to filter as well. 

We can use the same syntax, `cereal['mfr'] == 'Q'`, we normally would when filtering. However, this time we wrap the whole thing within `.loc[]`.

---



```{python}
cereal.loc[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr']
```


```{python}
cereal.loc[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] = 'Quaker'
```



Notes: 

Some people may be asking, "Why don't we do all our filtering like this then?" Well, the answer is, you can, but we prefer not to.  

Filtering without `.loc[]` is a bit more readable.

Let's concentrate back on our task of only replacing `mfr` values equal to `Q` to `Quaker`.  

How can `.loc[]` help us with this? 

Unlike our earlier approach, `.loc[]` accepts more arguments within it.  

We have the ability to specify not only the target rows matching a specific condition but our column of interest as well.

Once we have that, we can then assign these rows the new values `Quaker` in the `mfr` column. 

Wait!  Nothing was outputted with our code!  What happened?

---


```{python}
cereal
```




Notes:

Let's take a look at the original dataframe.

We can now see that the `Q` manufacturer values have changed to `Quaker`. 

When we use this syntax, we do not need to save the results in a new object like we had to with `.assign()` and `.drop()`. 

Let's discuss what really is happening behind the scenes. 

---




```{python}
cereal['mfr'] == 'Q'
```


Notes: 

Remember what the condition  `cereal['mfr'] == 'Q'` returns?

It produces an object containing all the rows with True/False values depending on whether or not the row meets the condition. 

---



<img src='/module2/tf_quaker.png'  alt="404 image" />   


Notes: 

Essentially our code is finding the rows with `True` values and replacing the values in the `mfr` colum with the new value of `Quaker`.  

---



1.  
```python
cereal.loc[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q']
```

<br>

2. 

```python
cereal.loc[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] 
```
<br>

3. 
```python
cereal.loc[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] = 'Quaker'
```


Notes: 

You can split up how this code works into 3 steps:

1. We use `.loc[]` to find the rows meeting certain conditions.

2. We next indicate which column we wish to access.

3. Once we have obtained our desired rows and the column which we are editing, we assign a value.

---



```python
cereal[cereal['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] = 'Quaker'
```

```




Notes: 

Does this work without using `.loc[]`?  

Let's give it a try. 

Unfortunately, we are not able to replace values in this manner and it results in an error since filtering this way does not allow us to specify a column.

---

# Replacing with inequalities. 


```{python}
cereal.loc[cereal['protein'] >= 3, 'protein_level']  = 'high' 
```


```{python}
cereal.loc[cereal['protein'] < 3, 'protein_level']  = 'low' 
```

Notes: 

This syntax using `.loc[]` also works for inequality conditions.

If we are replacing numerical values with characters or words (or vice versa) we need to assign our desired values to a **new column** and not the existing one, because the column type will be different.    

Perhaps we want just two categories for protein levels - "high" and "low".  

Any cereal above 3 grams of protein will be considered a "high" protein level and anything less, as a "low" protein level. 

Let's assign the "high" protein values first.  

The only difference here from earlier is we now use an inequality for our condition and we designate a new column name instead of an existing one.  

Let's save the values in a column named `protein_level`.

Next by the "low" values.


---


```{python}
cereal
```


Notes: 

Let's take a look at the dataframe now.

---

## Creating new columns 

```{python}
oz_to_g = 28.3495
cereal['weight_g'] = cereal['weight'] * oz_to_g
cereal
```




Notes: 

You may have noticed we did not use `.assign()` to create our new column.  

That's because as we mentioned earlier, when we use `.assign()` it creates a brand new dataframe. 

When we are replacing values, we don't want a new dataframe and instead, we just want to alter the current values in the existing dataframe.

When we are not doing conditional value replacement, we could create new columns with a similar syntax.  Take the example of converting the weight from ounces into grams and making a new column named `weight_g`. 

This code edits the existing dataframe `cereal` instead of creating a new one.  

We prefer to use `.assign()` where possible as it can help avoid unexpected errors and performance issues.
