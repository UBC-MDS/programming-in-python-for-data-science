```{python}
chart0 = alt.Chart(cereal, width=500, height=300).mark_circle().encode(
    x='mfr', 
    y='calories'
).properties(title="Scatter plot of manufacturer calorie content")

chart0
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart0.save(path + 'chart0.png')
```


<img src="/module2/chart0.png" alt="A caption" width="60%" />

Notes: 

Let's build on the Altair skills we learned in the previous module. 

At this point we are familiar with writing basic plotting code similar to the plot here. 

However it's important that we start specifying what kind of variable type we use for our `x` and `y` values in the `encode(..)` verb.

Before, Altair would guess what type of data it was plotting.  Usually it's pretty smart and guesses correctly like we saw in our previous plots. but unfortunately not always. 

---



```{python include =FALSE}
# convert the calories column to a string
cereal_modified = cereal
cereal_modified['calories'] = cereal_modified['calories'].astype(str)
```

```{python}

chart1 = alt.Chart(cereal_modified, width=500, height=300).mark_circle().encode(
    x='mfr', 
    y='calories'
).properties(title="Scatter plot of manufacturer calorie content")

chart1

```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart1.save(path + 'chart1.png')
```

<img src="/module2/chart1.png" alt="A caption" width="60%" />



Notes: 

Let's see an example where `Altair` fails to determine the correct data type. 

For this example, we have modified the `calories` column in the `cereal` dataframe. 

We will now generate a scatter plot of `mfr` and `calories` from this modified cereal dataset.

Notice how 150 come before 100 on the y-axis? It seems we have a problem here. 

Even Altair can’t always get it right every time, which is why it’s so important we specify the data type when plotting. 

---


```{python}
chart2 = alt.Chart(cereal_modified, width=500, height=300).mark_circle().encode(
    x='mfr:N', 
    y='calories:Q'
).properties(title="Scatter plot of manufacturer calorie content")

chart2
```

```{python include =FALSE}
chart2.save(path + 'chart2.png')
```

<img src="/module2/chart2.png" alt="A caption" width="60%" />

Notes: 

We can help Altair by giving it a clear instructions on what type of columns our X and Y values are. 

In this case we are going to specify `N` for the *nominal* column `mfr` and `Q` for the *quantitative* column `calories`. 

That's better! 

---



| Data Type   | Shorthand Code | Description | Examples |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Ordinal   | `O` | a discrete ordered quantity | “dislike”, “neutral”, “like” |
| Nominal | `N` | a discrete un-ordered quantity | eye color, postal code, university |
| Quantitative | `Q` |  a continuous  quantity | 5, 5.0, 5.011 |
| Temporal| `T` | a time or date value | date (August 13 2020), time (12:00 pm) |



Notes: 

Altair recognizes the following column types and it's best practices that we specify this when we plot graphs going forward. 

Ordinal values imply that there is some natural ordering to the values. 

For example, the ratings a movie receives is on an ordinal scale since a five star rating is better than a single star rating. 

In contrast, there is no such natural ordering for nominal values. 
An example of this would be someone's eye colour, their address or the university they attended.

Anything `numeric` is  considered a `quantitative` variable and `time` or `date` values are considered as `temporal`.


---




```{python}
chart3 = alt.Chart(cereal, width=500, height=300).mark_circle().encode(
    x='sugars:Q',  # set the sugars column as quantitative
    y='rating:Q'   # set the rating column as quantitative
).properties(title="Scatter plot of cereal rating vs sugar content")

chart3
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart3.save(path + 'chart3.png')
```

<img src="/module2/chart3.png" alt="A caption" width="60%" />


Notes: 

Let's practice this. 

Maybe we are interested in plotting the rating of cereals vs the amount of sugar they contain from `cereal` dataframe. 

We do this using a scatter plot which uses `.mark_circle()`. We can assign `sugars` as the the `x` variable and `ratings` as the `y` column from the `cereal` dataframe we have been using. 

Here, `sugars` and `rating` are both quantitative columns so we specify `Q` as variable types in our plot. 

---

# Variable types

```{python}
chart4 = alt.Chart(cereal, width=500, height=300).mark_circle().encode(
    x=alt.X('sugars:Q'), # use alt.X() to map the x-axis
    y=alt.Y('rating:Q')  # use alt.Y() to map the y-axis
).properties(title="Scatter plot of cereal rating vs sugar content")

chart4

```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart4.save(path + 'chart4.png')
```

<img src="/module2/chart4.png" alt="A caption" width="60%" />


Notes: 

So far when plotting with Altair, we have been mapping our `x` and `y` in the `encode(x=..,y=..)` verb. 

However, doing so gives us very little control on how exactly we would like to map our x and y values. 

In order to have more control, we can map our x and y values using `x=alt.X(...)` and `y=alt.Y(...)` respectively. 

This gives us a lot more option over the customization of our plot. You'll see this coming up. 

---

## Histograms

```{python}
chart5 = alt.Chart(cereal, width=500, height=300).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('calories:Q', bin=True), # set x-axis as calories 
    y=alt.Y('count():Q')             # set the y-axis as the occurrence count for each calorie value
).properties(title="Histogram plot of cereal calorie content")
chart5

```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart5.save(path + 'chart5.png')
```

<img src="/module2/chart5.png" alt="A caption" width="60%" />


Notes: 

Another type of plot we can make using Altair is called a **Histogram**. 

A histogram would be an ideal plot if we were interested in seeing how many cereals in our dataframe have calories withing certain range. A histogram is similar to a `bar` chart except that it groups quantitative data into ***ranges**, and the height of each bar shows the frequency of each range. 

We can generate a histogram plot of the `calories` values in the cereal dataframe. This will enable us to see the various values of calories and how many times they occur. 

To make a histogram, we use `mark_bar()`. 

In the `encode()` verb, we specify the x-axis as `calories` and use the argument `bin=True`. We assign the y-axis as `count():Q` to get the number of cereals that have values within each of the ranges.  

This is the same `count()` argument we use in Module 1 when we made bar charts. 

---

## Bins 


```{python}
chart6 = alt.Chart(cereal, width=500, height=300).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('calories:Q', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=20)), # set max number of bins to 20
    y=alt.Y('count():Q')
).properties(title="Histogram of cereal calorie content with bins = 20")
chart6

```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart6.save(path + 'chart6.png')
```

<img src="/module2/chart6.png" alt="A caption" width="60%" />




Notes: 

We have the ability to change the number of bars (bins) in our histogram by using the `bin` argument and the `alt.Bin()` verb.  

Within `alt.Bin()` we can specify `maxbins` which is the maximum allowed number of bins in our plot. 

This may be useful when viewing a dataset with lots of different values. 

Having control over the number of bins in a histogram can help to make visualization easier to extract insights from. 

Here, we set the number of bins in the plot to `20` by setting `bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=20)` inside `alt.X()`.

---



<img src="/module2/chart6.png" alt="A caption" width="70%" />


Notes: 

When plotting with Altair, the `x` and `y` axis are labelled with the default column names. 

This may not always be ideal since column names may not always be informative. 
In this plot, the x axis label `calories (binned)` is a little messy. 

Luckily Altair allows us to customize our axis labels. 

---



```{python}
chart7 = alt.Chart(cereal, width=500, height=300).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('calories:Q', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=20), title="Calorie Content"), # use alt.X() to label the x-axis
    y=alt.Y('count():Q', title="Number of Cereals")                          # use alt.Y() to label the y-axis
).properties(title="Histogram plot of cereal calorie content")
chart7
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart7.save(path + 'chart7.png')
```

<img src="/module2/chart7.png" alt="A caption" width="60%" />


Notes: 

We can change these axis labels using the `title=""` argument within the respective `alt.X()` and `alt.Y()` verbs that we talked about earlier. 

This is a big help for the clarity of our analysis.

---

```{python}
mfr_mean = cereal.groupby(by='mfr').mean()
mfr_mean
```

Notes: 

In the previous slide deck, we asked the following question regarding our cereal data:

***Which manufacturer has the highest mean sugar content?*** 

A nice way of answering this would be to plot the results using a bar chart! 

before doing this, we need a few more tricks under our belt. 

We can start using the mean statistics we calculated from `groupby(by='mfr')` object from the last section. 

Here we seem to have lost our index column of numbers we usually have and it appears that `mfr` has now moved to the left of the dataframe with it's label `mfr` lower than the other column labels.

This is because when you apply `groupby()` to a column, the grouping column becomes the new dataframe index. 

Although this is a useful feature in many cases, Altair cannot access the column names of index columns. 

---


```{python}
mfr_mean
```


```{python}
mfr_mean = mfr_mean.reset_index()
mfr_mean
```


Notes: 

To deal with this, we use `reset_index()` which will convert `mfr` to a regular column again.

We can see that `mfr` column has now moved right and our index column of integers has returned on the left!

---


```{python}
chart8 = alt.Chart(mfr_mean, width=500, height=300).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('mfr:N', title="Manufacturer"),
    y=alt.Y('sugars:Q', title="Mean sugar content")
).properties(title="Bar plot of manufacturers mean sugar content")
chart8

```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart8.save(path + 'chart8.png')
```

<img src="/module2/chart8.png" alt="A caption" width="60%" />


Notes: 

Now that we have our `mfr_mean` in the correct format, we can proceed.

Using Altair we can plot the `mfr` column on the x axis which we've identified to contain nominal values and `sugars` which we agreed was a quantitative value on the y axis. (Also we can't forget our title!)

---

<br>
<br>

1. Groupby object and calculated the mean
2. Reset index
3. Plot using Altair 

Notes: 

Let's go through the steps that were needed to make the plot in the previous slide. 

First, we created a groupby object and calculated the mean for each column in the resulting dataframe.       
Second, Since `.groupby()` made `mfr` the new index, we had to use `reset_index()` to make `mfr` a regular column again.
And finally, we generated a bar plot using Altair. 

---

## Sorting 

```{python}
chart9 = alt.Chart(mfr_mean, width=500, height=300).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('mfr:N', sort="y", title="Manufacturer"),  # use sort="y" to sort in ascending order
    y=alt.Y('sugars:Q', title="Mean sugar content")
).properties(title="Bar plot of manufacturers mean sugar content sorted in ascending order")
chart9
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart9.save(path + 'chart9.png')
```

<img src="/module2/chart9.png" alt="A caption" width="60%" />



Notes: 

Sometimes sorting a dataframe by quantity helps us obtain observations quicker. 

For example, if we sorted the mean sugar content for the manufacturers before generating the previous plot, it would be easier to identify which manufacturer produces cereals with the highest mean calorie content. 

Altair allows us to sort a column while plotting. 

Sorting can be done on either the x or y axis using the `sort=` in the `alt.x`  or `alt.y` verb.

The sort argument takes in either `x` or `y` to specify which axis to sort by.

Here we are sorting in ascending order of which manufacturers have the largest mean sugar content. 

This plot shows us immediately that cereals from manufacturer `p` have the highest mean sugar content.

---



```{python}
chart10 = alt.Chart(mfr_mean, width=500, height=300).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('mfr:N', sort="-y", title="Manufacturer"),  # use sort="-y" to sort in descending order
    y=alt.Y('sugars:Q', title="Mean sugar content")
).properties(title="Bar plot of manufacturers mean sugar content sorted in descending order")
chart10
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart10.save(path + 'chart10.png')
```

<img src="/module2/chart10.png" alt="A caption" width="60%" />

Notes: 

To generate a bar plot of mean calorie content sorted in `descending` order, we recycle the code from the previous slide. 

This time, we add `-y` in the `sort` argument to specify that we would like to sort the y variable in descending order.

<!-- We've added a title before, so there is nothing new there but adding x and y-axis labels is a little different. We can increase the label font sizes using the argument `fontsize`. In this case, we reference our initial plot and use the verb `.set_ylabel()` and `.set_xlabel()` with the desired axis label as an argument and `fontsize` to assign a desired label size.  -->
<!-- To avoid unnecessary information that will be returned otherwise, whatever our last verb being used with our plot (named `sugar_plot) has to be reassigned back to the object. If we did this any other way, we would not have the ability to do more transformations on our plot, or we would get additional information with the plot output.  -->
