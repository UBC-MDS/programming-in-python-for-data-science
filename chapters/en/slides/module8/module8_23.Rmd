## Replace



```{python}
cycling = pd.read_csv('cycling_data.csv')
cycling.head(10)
```


Notes: 

Ok, we have an idea of how we can do some fairly standard strings processing, however; it's time we dived a little deeper into this. 

There are **MANY** different functions but we'll concentrate on a couple here that we will use often and provide a list of several that will be useful in future string processing adventures. 

Just like in regular text, there will be times in your data analysis where you will want to replace some of the text within a string.  

That's where `.replace()` comes in. 

We usually like our data to be consistent, however; consistency is not always present even in the best of dataframes. 

Let's take a look at our cycling dataset.


---

```{python}
cycling_lower = cycling.assign(Comments = cycling['Comments'].str.lower())
cycling_lower.head(9)
```


Notes: 

Before we do anything, let's convert this whole column to lowercase, to make our life easier. 

This means we only need to be replacing 1 version of a single word instead of taking consideration all different case versions. 

---

```{python echo=FALSE}
cycling_lower.head()
```


```{python}
cycling_rain = cycling_lower.assign(Comments = cycling_lower['Comments'].str.replace('whether', 'weather'))
cycling_rain.head()
```

Notes: 

You'll notice in the third row, the word "whether" should have been spelled "weather". 

Let's replace this word in the entire dataset with the correct spelling of "weather".     

With `replace()`, the first argument is the word we are identifying, and the second is what we are replacing the first argument with.

We can see that the word `whether` has now been replaced with the more appropriate spelling of `weather`.


---

## Contains

```{python}
cycling_lower['Comments'].str.contains('rain')
```

```{python}
cycling_lower[cycling_lower['Comments'].str.contains('rain')]
```
 
Notes: 

`contains()` can be used to filter our dataframe.  

Instead of checking if a column equals an exact value, we can check in a  pattern is ***contained*** in the column. 

For example, what if we want all the rows that have some portion of "rain".

This will return a pandas series with Boolean values. 

We can combine this and use it as a condition to filter our dataframe on to obtain all the rows that contain the string "rain".

If we wanted to we could use this subset of data to see if our cyclist Tom was slower on average, on days that it rained!  

---

```{python include=FALSE}
rain_before = cycling_lower[cycling_lower['Comments'].str.contains('rain')]
```

```{python}
cycling_lower.loc[cycling_lower['Comments'].str.contains('rain'), 'Comments'] = 'rained'
```



Notes: 

`.replace()` can be somewhat limiting since we saw it can only replace specific strings that we specify.

What if we want to replace any of the values in the entire dataframe that contains the word `"rain"` to the word `"rained"`?

We actually know how to do this! 

We can pair our `.contains()` function with conditional value replacement using `.loc[]`! 

We learned about conditional value replacement back in Module 2. Let's see what this looks like.  

First we call our dataframe and inside the `.loc[]`  function we put our condition as the first argument and the column we wish to change or create in the second.

Next, on the right side of the assignment operation be specify the new value we wish to assign to these rows that meet this condition. 

Let's replace all rows with values that only contains `"rain"` with `"rained"`.

What does `cycling_lower` look like now? 

---

The rows originally filtered with "rain" in the dataset:
```{python echo=FALSE}
rain_before
```

Have now been been been replaced with "rained" in the `Comments` column:

```{python}
cycling_lower[cycling_lower['Comments'] == 'rained']
```

Notes: 

The rows originally filtered with "rain" in the dataset have now been been been replaced with "rained" in the `Comments` column.

rows 0, and 1 which both had values of `"rain"` and Rows 7 and 8 which were both `"raining"` and `"thankfully not raining today!"` repectively have now all been changed to the just `"rained"`.

rows 0, and 1 which both had values of `"rain"` and Rows 7 and 8 which were both `"raining"` and `"raining today"` repectively have now all been changed to the value `"rained"`.

Notes: 

There are quite a few other string methods that are available but this should get you started.
