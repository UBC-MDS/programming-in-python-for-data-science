# Range, dictionaries and comprehensions

Notes: 

<br>

## Range 


```{python}
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```


```{python}
for i in range(50, 101, 10):
    print(i)
```


Notes: 

Often, we just want to do something 5 times without looping over a collection. 

The most common way to do that is to use `range()`, which automatically generates a collection of the integers in some sort of sequence generally 0, to N-1 .

We can also specify a _start value_, an _end value_ and a _skip-by value_ with range. 

---

```python
range(start, end, skip)
```


```{python}
for i in range(7,10):
    print(i)
```


```{python}
for i in range(4):
    print(i)
```

```python
for i in range(0.5,1.0,0.1):
    print(i)
```

```out
TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer

Detailed traceback: 
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>

```

Notes: 

The range function specifies the starting integer first, the ending integer next and the skip by integer last.  

Similarly to slicing with `.iloc[]` in pandas, the starting point of `range()` is *included* in the sequence and the ending number is *excluded*.  

The skip-by variable is optional. 

In `range()`, the default skip number is 1, so if we don't include it, Python will assume to increase in increments of 1. 

If we only include a single integer in the function, a sequence up to the given number (but not including it) will be generated starting from `0`.

`range()` only works for integers.  If we attempt a loop with type `float`, an error will occur:

## Looping in a dictionary


```{python}
cereals = {'Special K': 4, 'Lucky Charms': 7, 'Cheerios': 2, 'Wheaties': 3}
cereals.items()
```


```{python}
cereals = {'Special K': 4, 'Lucky Charms': 7, 'Cheerios': 2, 'Wheaties': 3}

for cereal, stock in cereals.items():
    print( cereal  + " has " + str(stock) + " available")
```

Notes: 

We can also loop over the key-value pairs of a dictionary using `.items()`.  

We saw this verb back in module 4 when we learned about dictionaries. 

Since each key-value pair has 2 elements in it, we need to specify a variable for each item in the tuple:

- One for the dictionary **key**
- One for the dictionary **values**

Here we assign an object named `cereal` for the items in the first position of the tuple which are the dictionary keys , and an object named `stock` for the second index in tuple which are the dictionary values.

## Comprehensions

```{python}
numbers = [2, 3, 5]
```


```{python}
squared = list()

for number in numbers: 
    squared.append(number ** 2)
    
squared
```

```{python}
squared = [number ** 2 for number in numbers]
squared
```


Notes: 

We learned in the last Module that we can create `if` and `else` conditions in a single line of code and we can do something similar with basic loops. 

**Comprehensions** allow us to build lists/sets/dictionaries in one convenient, compact line of code.

In the last set of slides, we made a loop that calculates the square of each element from a list and adds them to a new list name `squared`. 

This can be done using comprehension so now it executes using the single line of code.

---


```{python}
numbers = [2, 3, 5]

word_length = {number : number ** 2 for number in numbers}
word_length
```


Notes: 

Dictionary comprehensions can be done in a similar way but this time we wrap the line with curly brackets and specify what our keys and values are.

In this case we name the element in the list `number`. 

We assign `number` as the dictionary key and the square of `number` as the dictionary value. 

Both methods of building lists and dictionaries work and it's down to you to decide what works better for you.
