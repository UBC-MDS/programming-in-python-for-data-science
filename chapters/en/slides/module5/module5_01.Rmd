# Making choices with conditionals

Notes: 

<br>

---


```{python}
cereal[cereal['mfr'] == 'K']
```
Notes: 

In the last Module, we explored the different data types and structures that Python offers. 

It's at this point in the course where we learn how to ask Python to make a decision, depending on conditions.

We did something similar when we filtered a dataframe using condition.


---

```python 
my_name = 'Hayley' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
    print("That's a great name.")
  
print('Nice to meet you!')

```

```out
My name is Hayley too!
Nice to meet you!
```




Notes: 

Let's start with an example of what the syntax looks like.

Perhaps we want to introduce ourselves in our code by using the object called `my_name`.  

We've assigned `'Hayley'` to the object `my_name` in this example. 

We use a verb called `print()` that simply prints the object or string set as an argument. 

We can see that since the object `my_name` is equal to `hayley`, the output is `My name is Hayley too`, followed by regular unconditioned code `Nice to meet you!`.



---


<center><img src='/module5/iftrue.png' width="100%"></center>



Notes: 

Python looks at the first condition `if my_name.lower() == 'hayley'` and since it evaluates to `True`, it prints the code under the statement which is `'My name is Hayley too!'`

Python passes the other `print()` statements  from the `elif` and `else` conditions and continues to run the rugular code `'Nice to meet you!`.

---



```python
my_name = 'Totoro' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
    print("That's a great name.")
  
print('Nice to meet you!')

```

```out
Interesting, I loved that movie!
Nice to meet you!
```



Notes: 

Now what happens if the object is equal to something else? 

This time, The object `my_name` has a value now of `Totoro`.

We see the output is `Interesting, I loved that movie! Nice to meet you!`

What is happening here? 

---

<center><img src='/module5/eliftrue.png' width="100%"></center>


Notes: 

 Python ignores the code under the first condition `if my_name.lower() == 'hayley'` since it evaluates to `False`.
 
 Instead, Python continues to the next condition `elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro'`which is `True` and executes the code under it which prints `'Interesting, I loved that movie!'`. 
 
 Python then skips over the next lines of code and goes straight to printing `'Nice to meet you!'`. 

---

```python 
my_name = 'Desmond' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
    print("That's a great name.")
  
print('Nice to meet you!')

```

```out 
That's a great name.
Nice to meet you!
````



Notes: 

Now we try something that meets neither the first or second conditions.

When `my_name`  is equal to `Desmond`, the first 2 conditions both evaluate to `False` and the last condition executesand prints `That's a great name.`. 

It executes the regular code  `print('Nice to meet you!')` just like before. 

---

<center><img src='/module5/elsetrue.png' width="100%"></center>

Notes: 

Here we see that neither the first or second conditions are met however, the print statement is executed. 

---

## Syntax  

```python
my_name = 'Hayley' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
    print("That's a great name.")
  
print('Nice to meet you!')

```

```out
My name is Hayley too!
Nice to meet you!
```



 

Notes: 

Python conditional statements contains 2 important things:    

 - A strict structure. 
 - The keyword `if` and optional keywords `else` and `elif`.  

---

## Structure 

```{python}
my_name = 'Hayley' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
```

The structure of a choice is as follows: 

```python
if SOME_BOOLEAN:
    statement body 
```

Notes: 

The structure of a choice is as follows: 

```python
if SOME_BOOLEAN:
    statement body 
```

Each conditional expression must end with a colon `:` and code to be execute if the condition is met must all must be indented with 4 spaces (or consistent indentation) in the **statement body**.    

In the example above:

`if my_name.lower() == 'hayley'` is the Boolean statement and 

`print("My name is Hayley too!")` is the statement body. 

---

## Keywords - if, else


```python
my_name = 'Mia' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
    print("That's a great name.")
  
print('Nice to meet you!')
```

```out 
That's a great name.
Nice to meet you!
````

Notes: 

An `if` keyword is needed for any conditional. 

If the Boolean value is `True`, the body of the statement (which is anything indented under it) will be executed. 

If the expression is `False`, the body of the statement is not executed and it continues to the next line of non-indended code outside the body. 

The `else` expression will execute if the conditional expressions above it are `False` 

The keyword `else` can only occur once following an `if` condition and are optional to the code. 

---

## Keywords - elif

```python
my_name = 'Totoro' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
    print("That's a great name.")
  
print('Nice to meet you!')

```

```out
Interesting, I loved that movie!
Nice to meet you!
```


Notes: 

`elif` stands for ***else if***.  It allows us to check if different conditions evaluate to `True`.

When the `elif` expression evaluates to `True`, then the body of the statement is executed, just like an `if` statement.


In the case we saw before when `my_name = 'Totoro'`, the `elif` condition `my_name.lower() == 'totoro'` evaluates to `True`. 

---

```python
if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
elif  my_name.lower() == 'Desmond':
    print("That's a great name.")
  
print('Nice to meet you!')

```

```python
my_name = 'Hayley' 

elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print("Interesting, I loved that movie!")
```

```out
Error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 2)
```

Notes: 

Unlike `else` statements, `elif` statements can be used multiple times in a decision process.

But `elif` statements **MUST** always follow an `if` statement or an error will occur like we see here. 

---

## Order matters



```{python}
item = 13 

if item > 10:
    magnitude = 'Between 10 and 20'
elif item > 20:
    magnitude = 'Greater than 20'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
 
magnitude
```



Notes: 

The order we chose for the statement for the `if` and `elif` statements is important and can result in different outputs.

Let's explore this in the next example using inequalities with numbers.

In this case, our `item` object which equals 13 here, is greater than 10 so our first condition holds true and so  magnitude is assigned a value of `'Between 10 and 20'`

---

```{python}
item = 25 

if item > 10:
    magnitude = 'Between 10 and 20'
elif item > 20:
    magnitude = 'Greater than 20'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
 
magnitude
```


Notes: 

Let's see what happens with an `item` value equal to 25. 

`magnitude` is still assigned a value of `'Between 10 and 20'` but our item is greater than 20! 


---

<center><img src='/module5/order1.png' width="70%"></center>


Notes: 

`item` is taken out of the stream at the first `if` condition, so it doesn't get a chance to see the `elif` statement even though it would result in a `True` value. 


---



```{python}
item = 25 

if item > 20:
    magnitude = 'Greater than 20'
elif item > 10:
    magnitude = 'Between 10 and 20'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
 
magnitude
```



Notes: 

This can be fixed by rearranging the conditional statements.

Instead, we put `item > 20` as the first condition followed by the condition `item > 10`. 

Now a value of 25 gives the desired output of `greater than 20`.

---

<center><img src='/module5/order2.png' width="70%"></center>

Notes:

Here we can see that the first condition is `True` and executes the code in the statement body - This statement body assigns the object `magnitude` a value of `'Greater than 20'`. 

Python then passes the other conditions and executes `magnitude`.

---

```{python}
item = 13 

if item > 20:
    magnitude = 'Greater than 20'
elif item > 10:
    magnitude = 'Between 10 and 20'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
 
magnitude
```


Notes:

But what about if `item` was equal to 13?

In this case, `magnitude` results in a value of `'Between 10 and 20'` which is what we expect.

---

<center><img src='/module5/order3.png' width="70%"></center>

Notes: 

Since 13 doesn't meet the first condition `item > 20`, Python passes it and moves onto the second condition `item > 10` which assigns `magnitude` the value  `Between 10 and 20`. 

It skips the `else` statement since one of the statements above was already evaluated to `True`.  

---

## Inline


```{python}
item = 13
```



```{python}

if  item > 10:
    magnitude = 'Greater than 10'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
    
magnitude
```



```{python}
list_size = "Greater than 10" if item > 10 else "10 or less"
list_size
```


Notes: 

In situations where we have only `if` and `else` statements, we have the ability to put it all in a single line of code.

Let's test this on our object `item`. 

The original conditional statements below checks if the item is greater than 10 and assigns a value of `greater than 10` if it's `True` and a  value of `10 or less` otherwise. 

The 4 lines used for the conditional statements can be compressed into a single one.

Both syntaxes are acceptable depending on your preference. 

This type of syntaxes is only possible for decisions that involve only `if` and `else` conditions.

### Python Keyword "in"  


```{python}
exercises = ['burpees', 'lunges', 'squats', 'curls', 'deadlifts']

'squats' in exercises
```



```{python}
if 'squats' in exercises:
    sore = "Extreme"
else:
    sore = "Not sore"
sore
```


Notes: 

We've already seen that conditions evaluate to a Boolean. 

So far we've seen a lot of Boolean evaluated from equalities and inequalities but that's not all. 

There are many different keywords we can use in to obtain a Boolean value but one that you may use often is the keyword `in`. 

We can use the keyword `in` to check if a certain value is contained in a list or dictionary. 

We can pair this with with condition statement like we did before to have Python makes decisions/ . 

In this example we are checking if `squats` is contained in our list `exercises`. 

We can see that `squats` exists ar position 2 in the list and therefore the objext `sore` is assigned a value of `Extreme`.
