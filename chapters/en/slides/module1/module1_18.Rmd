# Selecting a Single Column

---

```python
df.loc[:, ['column name']]
```
<br>

```{python}
cereal.loc[:, ['type']]
```

Notes: 

Something we often do in data analysis is obtain a single column from a dataframe.
We can again use `.loc[]` to do this which would look something like this in general:

`dataframe.loc[:, ['column name']]` 

So if we here want the column named `type` from our cereal dataframe we could use the syntax: 

`cereal.loc[:, ['type']]` 

This seems a bit long winded and since we do this type of thing often. Luckily, Pandas has provided a quicker syntax to use to do the same thing. 

---

``` Python
df[['column name']]
```

<br>


```{python}
cereal[['type']]
```

Notes:

Instead, selecting a single column can be done without using `.loc[]` and we can just specify the dataframe name, followed by double square brackets containing the column of interest.

`cereal[['type']]`

This makes the syntax for selecting the column `type` from the `cereal` dataframe very easy.
