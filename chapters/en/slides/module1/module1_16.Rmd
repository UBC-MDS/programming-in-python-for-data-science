# Obtaining dataframe values

Notes:  <br>

---


```{python}
cereal.loc[[63]]
```


```{python}
cereal.loc[63, 'calories']
```


Notes: 

At this point of the module, we now know how to get a subset of an existing dataframe but what if we just want to get a single value from it?

For example, what if I wanted to save the calorie content of `Shredded Wheat` by extracting it from the dataframe and not manually typing in the number?

We specify the row we are targeting (63), followed by the column.

This displays the the value contained in the cell, which in this case, is 80.

```{python}
cereal.loc[[66]]
```


```{python}
cereal.loc[66, 'rating']
```



Notes:

What about if we wanted the rating of `Smacks` which is located at index 66?

Then we use `.loc[]`, specify the row and the column location separated by a comma.

You will be using this often so let's make sure we practice this one right away!
