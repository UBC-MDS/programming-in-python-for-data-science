# Frequency Tables and Writing CSVs 

Notes: <br>

---

## What is Frequency?

_*Frequency*_: The number of times a value occurs within the data. 

```{python}
candybars_mini
```

## What is a Frequency Table?

```{python echo=FALSE}

candybars_mini['available_canada_america'].value_counts()
```
Notes: 

Before we explain what a frequency table is, you must know what frequency means first. 

_*Frequency*_ is simply put, the number of times a value occurs within the data. Let's look at an example using our candybars dataset.

If we count the number of times the value `Both` appears in the `available_canada_america` column, we get 3 times. This is the frequency of the value `both`.  

A frequency table is a manner of displaying all the possible values of a column in our dataframe and the number of occurrences (frequencies) of each value. 

For our sample data, a frequency table for the `available_canada_america` column would look like this: 

---



```{python}
mfr_column = cereal['mfr']
mfr_column
```

```{python}
mfr_freq = mfr_column.value_counts()
mfr_freq
```


Notes: 

If we want to get a frequency table of a categorical column, there are a few steps that need to be followed. 

Up until now, we discussed getting a single column from a dataframe using double square brackets - `df[['column name']]`. 

For frequency tables, however, we only use single brackets to obtain the column values.

We saved the object in this example here to an object named `mfr_column` in the same way that we have done this before.   

Now we can use `.value_counts()` on this `mfr_column` variable to reference it, and we can obtain the frequency value for the different categories in that variable.


---


```{python}
mfr_col_wrong = cereal[['mfr']]
mfr_col_wrong
```


```python
mfr_col_wrong.value_counts()
```

```out
AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'value_counts'

Detailed traceback: 
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/generic.py", line 5274, in __getattr__
    return object.__getattribute__(self, name)
```

Notes: 

If we did instead use double square brackets with `pd.value_counts()`, we would get an error. So it is important to take care and remember when you are using `value_counts()`, you only use one set of square brackets.


---

## Saving a dataframe

```{python}
mfr_freq.to_csv('mfr_frequency.csv', index=False)
```


Notes: 

Sometimes it is useful to save a new dataframe to a file like a csv file for future use by you or somebody else.

We can do this using a method called `.to_csv()`. 

We put our desired `csv` file name in quotations within the parentheses and follow it with the argument `index=False` so we don't export our index column which is just a column of numbers.
