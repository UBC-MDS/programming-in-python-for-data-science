# Python data types

Notes: <br>

---

## Values and Objects 
    
 * We have been working with **values**, which are pieces of data that a computer program works with, such as a number or text.
 * We have been assigning a lot of these **values** (with the assignment operator  `=`) to  **objects**. 


```{python}
pet = 'Fido' 
pet
```

```{python}
age = 6
age
```



Notes: 

In the last few sections, you may have had questions like:   

***"Why are some values in quotation marks while others are not?"***,  

***"What are these square brackets we keep using in our verb arguments?"*** or    

***"Why can we take the mean of some columns and not others?"*** . 

We'll be answering these questions in this module. 

Python needs to categorize things to make sense of them. 

Let's start with some basics. 

In these cases, `pet` and `age` are **objects**, and `Fido` and `6` are **values.** 

These objects can be named anything that begins with a letter and is not "special python words" like **range**, **for**, **if**, **else**,  etc. (we will talk about some of those in the next module). 

---

## Data Types 


Here are some data types built-in to the Python language: 

* Integers - `int`
* Floating-point numbers - `float`
* Strings - `str`
* Booleans -`bool`
* Lists - `list`
* Tuples - `tuple`
* Sets - `set`
* Dictionaries - `dict`



Notes: 

Values, as we saw in our `Fido` and `6` examples, can be a variety of different things that get classified by Python as **data types**. 

---

## Numerical Data Types

### **Int**      


```{python}
age = 6 
type(age)
```

### **Float**

```{python}
age = 6.0
type(age)
```


Notes: 

You've likely noticed that we have not needed to put any quotation marks around number values. 
Python recognizes numbers as one of two possible types.   

Either as an ***integer***  called an `int` type or a ***floating-point number*** called a `float`. 

An `int` value is a whole number that is either positive, negative, or zero. 

We can use the verb `type()` to find out how Python classifies the value that is stored in an object. 

`6` is of type `int`. 

A `float` value is a real number in decimal form. That means even if we have a whole number if it contains a decimal point, it is considered a `float`.

In contrast, `6.0` is if type `float`.

---

## NaN

```{python}
weather
```


```{python}
nan_value = weather.loc[2,'31st']
nan_value
```

```{python}
type(nan_value)
```



Notes: 

Something you may have noticed in our Pandas dataframes are `NaN` values. 

This stands for **Not A Number**, and it is a special value used to represent missing data in pandas.

Contrary to its acronym, it is considered a numeric value, specifically of type `float`!

Ignore the `numpy` and `64` for now and concentrate on the `float` classification for now. We will be discussing NumPy more in Module 8.

Unlike other values, `NaN` cannot be converted to any other type other than a `float.`

---

## NoneType 


```{python}
name_of_bed_monster = None
```


```{python}
type(name_of_bed_monster)
```


 
Notes: 

Unlike `NaN` which is a special `float` value, `NoneType` is its own type, with only one possible value, `None`.

Let's say we need to save the name of the monster living under my bed in an object. Unfortunately, we have yet to introduce ourselves to him, so we are not sure what his name is. We also need to keep track that we are missing this information. 

We've seen this data type in our assignments when we replace the `None` provided with our solution. Since we still need to have the object created for the structure of our assignments, we simply use `None` to indicate the object exists but is devoid of information.

---

## Booleans 

The Boolean (`bool`) type has two values: **True** and **False**.



```{python}
type(False)
```


```{python}
weather
```

```{python}
weather['season'] == 'winter'
```





Notes: 

The Boolean type has two values: **True** and **False**. As you can see at the top, the value `False` is of type `bool` for Boolean.

We have seen this data type when we were filtering our dataframes with conditions. 

In pandas, a condition is evaluated and produces a column indicating whether the condition was met or not for each row. 

This column is a Boolean type.

---

## Strings 

- Single quotes, e.g., `'Hello'`
- Double quotes, e.g., `"Goodbye"`
- Triple single quotes, e.g., `'''Yesterday'''`
- Triple double quotes, e.g., `"""Tomorrow"""`

```{python}
name_of_bed_monster = 'Mike Wazowski'
name_of_bed_monster
```

```{python}
name_of_bed_monster = "Mike Wazowski"
name_of_bed_monster
```


```{python}
name_of_bed_monster = """Mike Wazowski"""
name_of_bed_monster
```

Notes: 

Text is stored as a data type called a string (`str`).

We think of a string as a sequence of characters enclosed in some form of quotations. 

We've been mostly using single quotations for strings up until this point, but you can enclose them with different types of quotation marks, as shown here.  


---

```{python}
saying = '''Mike Wazowski said: "My name's Mike Wazowski!"'''
saying
```



```{python}
missing_bed_monster = ''
missing_bed_monster
```


```{python}
type(missing_bed_monster)
```



Notes: 

If the string contains quotation marks or apostrophes, we can use double quotes or triple single quotes, or triple-double quotes to define the string.   

What about empty quotations? When we discussed `None` type, and we didn't yet know the monster's name, we could have also set it to an empty string, as shown here. The benefit of this approach is that we're already setting the type of the object to string, rather than NoneType.


---

## String Verbs 

There are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods" target="_blank">A variety of different methods</a>  to transform strings or extract information from them.

```{python}
name_of_bed_monster = 'Mike Wazowski'
```

- `len()`:

```{python}
len(name_of_bed_monster)
```

-  `.upper()`:

```{python}
name_of_bed_monster.upper()
```

- `.lower()`:

```{python}
name_of_bed_monster.lower()
```


Notes: 

There are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods" target="_blank">A variety of different methods</a>  to transform strings or extract information from them. Here are a few of them.

- We can obtain the number of characters in a string with `len()`.
- We can change the cases to capitals with `.upper()`.
- Or change the cases to lower case with `.lower()`.

---

```{python}
name_of_bed_monster = 'Mike Wazowski'
```


```{python}
name_of_bed_monster.count('k')
```


```{python}
name_of_bed_monster.count('K')
```



Notes: 

We can also count the number of times a substring or character is present in a string with `.count()`.

It's important to note that many of these verbs are case sensitive!

---

## Casting

- `int` to  `float`: 

```{python}
number_of_floating_balloons = float(5)
type(number_of_floating_balloons)
```

- An `int` to a `str`:
```{python}
number_of_balloon_strings = str(5)
type(number_of_balloon_strings)
```

- `float` to an `int` (it will round down to the nearest full integer). 

```{python}
number_of_balloons = int(4.99)
number_of_balloons
```



Notes:

Sometimes we need to explicitly transform an object from one type to another, which is called ***casting***. 

We can do this for some types, but not all. 

To cast an object to a new type, we use verbs corresponding to the desired type, such as `int()`, `float()`, `bool()` or `str()`. 

---

```{python}
bool(0)
```

```{python}
bool(5.0)
```

```{python}
int(False)
```

```{python}
float(True)
```


Notes: 

We can even convert `int` and `float` values to `bool` values.

Values of `0` or `0.0` are converted to `False,` and all other numeric are converted to `True`. 

We can convert Boolean values to `int` and `float` values where `False` is 0 or 0.0 respectively and `True` is 1 or 1.0. 

---


```{python}
str(True)
```

```{python}
str(None)
```

```{python}
str(3.2)
```


Notes: 

As suspected, the same applies to strings: Most data types can be converted to strings easily.

We don't even need to use `type()` here as we can see, both values now have quotations surrounding the value, meaning they are strings. 

---


```{python}
float('0')
```

```{python}
bool('True')
```

```{python}
bool('False')
```

```{python}
bool('0')
```


Notes: 

Casting strings into other data types is a bit more problematic.    

Sometimes it works correctly.

Other times it does not give us what we expected, as we can see here - the string False is converted to the Boolean True. Be careful when casting types! 

---

```{python}
bool('Hello')
```


```{python}
bool('')
```


```python
float('five')
```

```out
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'five'

Detailed traceback: 
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
```

Notes: 

In fact, only the empty string gets cast to False; every other string is considered True when turned into a Boolean.

Often, we may not be able to cast a string at all.

---


```{python}
bool(None)
```

```python
float(None)
```

```out
TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number, not 'NoneType'

Detailed traceback: 
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
```

 

Notes: 

These nuisances can be expected with `NoneType` values as well.

In summary, take care when casting values.
