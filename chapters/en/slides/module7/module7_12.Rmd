Notes: 

We've talked a lot about how to make sure our code works and that it does what we want it to, but just because it works, doesn't mean it's maintainable! 

Code has two “users” - the computer (which turns it into machine instructions) and humans, who will likely read and/or modify the code in the future.

This is why it's important to make your code suitable to that second audience, humans.

Writing readable and understandable code is important when sharing code to other users and reading back as your future self!

Remember: “Code is read much more often than it is written.”

### PEP8 

PEP8 is a style guide that recommends formatting such as:

- Indenting using 4 spaces
- Having whitespace around operators, e.g. x = 1 not x=1
- Avoiding extra whitespace such as f(1), not f (1)
- Single and double quotes for strings, but only using “””triple double quotes”””, not ‘’’triple single quotes’’’
- Variable and function names using underscores_between_words

### flake8

<br> <center><img src='/module7/flake8.png'  width = "45%" alt="404 image" /></center>


Notes: 

PEP8 is one of the many style guides used in programming. 

PEP8 recommends formatting such as:

- Indenting using 4 spaces
- Having whitespace around operators, e.g. x = 1 not x=1
- But avoiding extra whitespace such as f(1), not f (1)
- Single and double quotes both fine for strings, but only using “””triple double quotes”””, not ‘’’triple single quotes’’’
- Variable and function names use underscores_between_words

We can check our code to see if it complies with PEP8 formatting using a Python library called `flake8`. 

Think of it as a grammar check but for your code. 

`flake8` will tell us how and where our code is formatted poorly but it won't make any changes to it. That is up to us. 

We will show you shortly, how to use `flake8` in your Jupyter notebooks.

## Black

**Before `black`**
```{python}
def exponent_a_list(numerical_list   ,   exponent   =      2):

    if type(numerical_list         ) is    not list   :
                raise Exception(     "You are not using a list for the numerical_list input."   
                )

    new_exponent_list   = list()
    for   number_in_new_exponent_list in              numerical_list:
                new_exponent_list.append(                  number_in_new_exponent_list **  exponent  )
    return new_exponent_list
```

**After `black`**
```{python}
def exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):

    if type(numerical_list) is not list:
        raise Exception("You are not using a list for the numerical_list input.")

    new_exponent_list = list()
    for number_in_new_exponent_list in numerical_list:
        new_exponent_list.append(number_in_new_exponent_list ** exponent)
    return new_exponent_list
```


Notes: 

Unlike PEP8 which is a style guide and `flake8` which just tells you where your code needs changes, `black` is a tool that will format your code. 

`black` will mostly follow the PEP8 style guide but with a few differences. 

When you use `black` with your code, you are wiping it of bad formatting like trailing whitespace and poor indentation. 


---

**After `black`**
```{python}
def exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):

    if type(numerical_list) is not list:
        raise Exception("You are not using a list for the numerical_list input.")

    new_exponent_list = list()
    for number_in_new_exponent_list in numerical_list:
        new_exponent_list.append(number_in_new_exponent_list ** exponent)
    return new_exponent_list
```

**Checking with `flake8` again**

<img src='/module7/flake8again.png'  width = "45%" alt="404 image" />


Notes: 

It's important to know that `flake8` and our formatter `black` are using slightly different rules. 
Even after `black` is run on our code, `flake8` still may point out issues and complain that it isn't stylized correctly. 

We’re not going to worry about that for now. It can be fixed by customizing `flake8` but that’s outside the scope of this course.

Now let's see how we can use both of these in a Jupyter notebook.


---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_01.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

Now that you know a little bit about what `flake8` and `black` can do, let's see how we use them.  

Here is a blank Jupyter notebook with the `exponent_a_list`  Python script that you saw in the last section. 


---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_02.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

This time, our `exponent_a_list()` function is not as it was formatted before. 

We've got space and indentation issues and it looks like we are missing white space in areas as well.

---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_05.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

First let’s see if the `exponent_a_list()` function works. 

I've got this empty notebook that we need to add a new cell to. 

We can do so by clicking the `+` button in the toolbar. 

By default it will add a code type cell to the notebook but what if we want a text cell? 

All we have to do is click on `markdown` in the toolbar and it will change to a text cell. 



---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_06.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

Let's import our function using the same code Tiffany showed us before. 

We specify first `from` and then the name of the script - in this case, the file name is `exponent_a_list` and we follow that with the name of the specific function so `exponent_a_list` again. 

Next, we run it and it looks like it’s imported into our notebook. 


---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_07.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

Let's test out the function `exponent_a_list()` with a list containing the values 1, 3 and 7. 


We are intentionally not adding spaces between the comma so that we can use it as a formatting example shortly. 

---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_08.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

The function works even with the bad formatting but let’s make our code more readable for our human user now. 



---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_09.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

Instead of doing everything ourselves and going line-by-line to check our code,  we can use `flake8` to tell us exactly what we need to fix.

By clicking on the addition sign on the top left of the toolbar, we can access the **Launcher** where we can open our **terminal**. 



---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_15.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

To use `flake8` in the terminal, all we have to do is type `flake8` followed by the name of the file we want to check ; in this case `exponent_a_list.py`.



---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_16.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

 This produces an output of all the formatting issues we need to amend. 


---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_17.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

We can see that at line 1 column 45, we have `multiple spaces before the operator` which means in our that’s where we will need to make changes in the file `exponent_a_list.py`. 

We can then go through all of these suggestions and correct them so that our `exponent_a_list.py` is adhering to a cleaner style. 



---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_19.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

Not only can we check Python scripts but notebooks files as well! 

In our terminal, we write something a little different. 

We type `flake8-nb` followed by the name of the notebook:
```
flake8-nb example.ipynb
``` 

`example` is the name of the notebook and Jupyter notebooks end with `.ipynb`.



---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_20.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

We can see in this case that `flake8-nb` caught the missing white space after the commas in our code `exponent_a_list([1,3,7)` inside the notebook. 



---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_22.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

Not only can you check `flake8` in a terminal but you can check it in a Jupyter notebook as well. 

This time I’m going to run `flake8` but in a code cell in our `example` notebook.

We write almost the same thing we did in our terminal except for this time we precede the code with an exclamation mark:

```
!flake8 exponent_a_list.py
``` 
Now we see all the formatting flags in our notebook instead of our terminal. 




---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_24.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 


We could go through all the issues one by one and fix them individually or we can use `black` which does this (well, most of it) for us. 

Just like `flake8`, we can do this in the terminal or in our Jupyter notebook.

Let’s first try it in a Jupyter notebook. 
 
We can use the exclamation mark followed by `black` and then the file name so in this case:

```
!black exponent_a_list.py
```

Before pressing enter and running this, let’s look at the file first. 




---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_25.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

We can see that the code in the `exponent_a_list.py` is still looking pretty messy. 



---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_23.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

Now we are can run this cell and we get the output:

 ```
reformatted are exponent_a_list.py. 
All done!  ✨ 🍰 ✨
1 file reformatted
``` 



---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_26.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

When we open up the file `exponent_a_list.py`, we can see that a lot of the white space has been removed and the indentations have been fixed! 

Remember it's not perfect! We can still see blank lines here that probably shouldn't be but it does a pretty good job. 



---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_27.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 


Now that we've done it in a Jupyter notebook, let’s try it in our terminal. 

We do the same thing as in a Jupyter notebook but this time without the exclamation point. 

```
Black exponent_a_list.py
```


---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_28.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

This time this file has also already been formatted so the output now is 
```
All done!  ✨ 🍰 ✨
1 file unchanged
```  

---
<br>
<center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_29.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

One last quick tool that we want to show you is this `black` Jupyter notebook extension. This lets you format your code cells in your Jupyter notebook directly. 
All you have to do is right-click on the cell you want to format and press “format cell”.

---

<br> <center><img src='/module7/m7_s12_30.png'  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

It will formats your cell right away. 

So that is how you can use `flake8` and black to clean up your code. 

Remember these tools don’t do everything. 

You’ll learn about some of the things that `black` and `flake8` don’t pick up in the next section.
