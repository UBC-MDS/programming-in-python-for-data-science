- Find, replace and extract text from a dataframe using verbs such as `.replace()`. 
- Identify missing and erroneous values in a dataframe and manage them by removing them using `.dropna()` or replacing them using `.fillna()`.
- Use NumPy to create ndarrays with `np.array()` and from functions such as `np.arrange()`, `np.linspace()` and `np.full()`
- Describe resulting array shapes from operations 
- Convert between a NumPy ndarray to a Pandas Dataframe.
