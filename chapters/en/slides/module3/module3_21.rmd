# Joining dataframes using merge

Notes: <br>

<center><img src='/module3/mergex.gif' width="800"></center>


Notes: 

We discussed concatenation in the last section and it how it glues dataframes together, but what if we needed to combine dataframes of different sizes where rows need to be matched up?       

<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.merge.html" target="_blank">`.merge()`</a> if a verb that give more precision and options when we join dataframes. 

We compared `.merge()` in the last section to stitching fabric together, where we line up the patterns of each piece of cloth. 

Unlike `pd.concat()`, `.merge()` can only combined dataframes horizontally but it can do so in many different ways. 

---

## Introducing the Data  



```{python}
candy = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', nrows=5, usecols=['name', 'weight', 'chocolate', 'peanuts'])
candy.head()
```



Notes: 

With  `.merge()`, we need to identify a column in each dataframe that acts as a connection between them.  

It's a column where the values in Dataframe A are the same values to those in Dataframe B. 

In the easiest situations both columns are named the same thing, but that doesn't have to be the case.

Let's use a subset of the candy bars dataset to explain this concept further. 

`candy` has a column labelled `name` which has unique candy bar names. 


---

```{python}
candy
```


Let's load in the next dataset:

```{python}
candy2m = pd.read_csv('candybars_merge.csv')
candy2m
```


Notes: 

This dataframe has new columns and rows not in the `candy` dataframe (`3 Musketeers`, `Aero`, and `Kinder Bueno`).
We can see that a column named `chocolate_bar` is the same variable as the `name` column in the `candy` dataframe. 

---



```python
candy.merge(...)
```



```python
candy.merge(candy2m, ...)
```


Notes: 

When we combine dataframes using `.merge()`,  it's quite different than `pd.concat()`. 

First, we decide which dataframe will be our left dataframe by implementing the merge verb on the selected dataframe.  We are going to choose `candy` as our left dataframe.

Next, we specify the right dataframe as the first argument in `.merge()`.  In our case, that's `candy2m`.

The last step, which is the bulk of the work, is specifying the arguments. 

We need to make sure we indicate which columns are the identifying key columns for each dataframe and what type of joining we want in our resulting dataframe. 


---

## Key Columns

`.merge()` needs arguments that identify a common **key** column.  This is a column present in both dataframes which contain common values. 

To choose our key columns in each dataframe, we use the following arguments:    

- `left_on` - The left dataframe identifying key column label.
- `right_on` - The right dataframe identifying key column label.



Notes: 

`.merge()` needs arguments that identify a common **key** column.  This is a column present in both dataframes which contain common values. 

Key columns do not need to be named identically.     

To choose our key columns in each dataframe, we use the following arguments:    

- `left_on` - The left dataframe identifying key column label.
- `right_on` - The right dataframe identifying key column label.

For example:  
Dataframe A can have a column labelled `cereal` and Dataframe B could have a column labelled `product_name` that both share cereal names.  

---

```{python}
candy
```



```{python}
candy2m
```



Notes: 

Our `candy` dataframe which we said was our left dataframe, would use the argument `left_on='name'`.

our `candy2m` dataframe is our right dataframe and would use the argument `right_on='chocolate_bar'`. 

---



```{python}
candy.merge(candy2m, left_on='name', right_on='chocolate_bar')
```




Notes: 

We combine that with the earlier code to get the following dataframe. 

Great, we've combined the 2 dataframes horizontally. In the future, we may want to drop the columns named `chocolate_bar` or rename it before we merge.

If our identifying columns are named the same in both dataframes, `.merge()` only keeps one of them.

Ok so what happened? We now only have 2 rows!  We seemed to have lost all the rows that are not in both columns. 
   
This is because `.merge()` uses a default joining method called `inner` join, which returns only the rows present in both dataframes.  We can change that with the argument `how`.

---

## how




```{python}
candy.merge(candy2m, left_on='name', right_on='chocolate_bar', how='inner')
```


<br>

<img src='/module3/inner.png' width="900">



Notes: 

The `how` argument specifies ***"how"*** our dataframes are joined. 

We mentioned that the default argument value `inner` will only keep the rows with identifying column values that are present in both dataframes.

---

But there are 4 types of joins we could choose from for the `how` argument: 

- `inner`
- `outer`
- `left`
- `right`


Notes: 

But there are 4 types of joins we could choose from for the `how` argument.

---


- `outer`


```{python}
candy.merge(candy2m, left_on='name', right_on='chocolate_bar', how='outer')
```


Notes: 

- `outer` will return not only the rows with identifying column values that are present in both tables but all the rows in both tables.  If there are any rows where any of the column values are missing, it will be filled with a `NaN` value.

Let's colour coordinate this table and explore it on the next slide.

Notes: 


Here we see that `Coffee Crisp` and `Butterfinger` have complete rows.  

Rows from the left dataframe that were not present in the right dataframe are `Skor`, `Smarties` and `Twix` and therefore have `NaN` values for columns from the right table.  

The opposite occurs for the values `3 Musketeers`, `Aero` and `Kinder Bueno` which are present in the right dataframe and not the left one.  

This results in `NaN` for values in the left dataframe columns. 

---


- `left`


```{python}
candy.merge(candy2m, left_on='name', right_on='chocolate_bar', how='left')
```


<img src='/module3/left.png' width="750">

Notes: 

The value `left` will only output the rows that are in the left dataframe and if they are missing from the right dataframe, `NaN` values will occur.  No candy bars that are only present in the right dataframe will be present.

Here we can see the values `3 Musketeers`, `Aero` and `Kinder Bueno` are not present in the resulting dataframe as they are only present in the right one. 

---

- `right`

```{python}
candy.merge(candy2m, left_on='name', right_on='chocolate_bar', how='right')
```

<img src='/module3/right.png' width="750">

Notes: 

- `right` will only output the rows that are in the right dataframe and if they are missing from the left dataframe, `NaN` values will occur.  No candy bars that are only present in the left dataframe will be present. 


We can see that the rows `Skor`, `Smarties` and `Twix` that were only present in the left dataframe, have been dropped. 


One thing that all 4 joins have in common, is they all will have the same columns labels that came from both dataframes. 

---

## indicator

 


```{python}
candy.merge(candy2m, left_on='name', right_on='chocolate_bar', how='outer', indicator=True)
```



Notes: 

`indicator` makes a new column name `_merge` and informs us from which dataframe the row originated from. 

If we want to do an outer join and show all the possible rows from both dataframes there is a useful argument called `indicator`.


Here we can see three possible values `left_only`, `right_only` or `both` which informs us if the row came from the left dataframe, the right dataframe or if the row index label is shared between both dataframes.
