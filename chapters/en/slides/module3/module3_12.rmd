# Concatenating dataframes

Up until this moment, we have been working with a single dataframe.  Many organizations split their data into multiple tables and join them together depending on what columns they need for their analysis.  
There are 2 different verbs we use for joining dataframes together: 

- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html" target="_blank">`.concat()`</a>; A forceful way of joining dataframes across rows or columns.  A useful analogy is the gluing or taping of 2 pieces of paper together so the shapes match up. 
- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.merge.html" target="_blank">`.merge()`</a> A more precision based approach for combining data on common columns or indices.  This can be compared to stitching fabric together so that the pattern/print lines up.

## Concatenation 

Concatenation works extremely well when you have similar dataframes which both share identical column or row index labels.  
`.concat()` can glue the 2 dataframes together either horizontally or vertically.

For the next couple of examples, we are going to look at concatenating with a subset of our original candy bars dataframe.

```{python}
candy = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv').loc[:4, 'name': 'peanuts']
candy
```

This dataframe has 5 rows and 4 columns.

## Horizontal Concatenation

`candybars2.csv` is a new dataframe that has additional nutritional information about each candy bar.  You'll notice that this dataframe has the same number and order of candy bars and 4 columns.

```{python}
candy2 = pd.read_csv('candy_bars2.csv')
candy2
```

We want to combine `candy2` with `candy` horizontally.

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We can combine these two dataframes using `pd.concat()` but we need to clarify on which axis to combine. 
We use square brackets around the dataframes we wish to glue together.  In the context of dataframes, it's normal to refer to `axis=1` as the columns of the dataframe and `axis=0` as the rows.  Since we are performing a horizontal concatenation, we need to use the argument `axis=1`.

```{python}
candy_nutrition = pd.concat([candy, candy2], axis=1)
candy_nutrition
```

This results in the same 4 rows but now we have 8 columns. 

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

After inspection, we can see that there are 2 `name` columns, which isn't necessary. 

```{python}
candy_nutrition
```

We can remove any duplicate columns by using both `.duplicated()` and `.loc[]`:

```{python}
candy_nutrition.loc[:,~candy_nutrition.columns.duplicated()]
```

This removed one of the `name` columns.  The code simply means that we are selecting all the rows using and only the non-duplicated rows for columns. 
You may have noticed a new symbol `~`that we have not seen before!  Meet the bitwise operator, also known as ***Tilde***.

---

### Tilde

***Tilde*** gives us the ability to return the compliment of the code following it.  Let's take a closer look.
This code shows us whether a column is a duplicated column not:

```{python}
candy_nutrition.columns.duplicated()
```

Using `.loc[]` without `~` selects only the columns with a "True" value, similarly to what happens when we filter. 

```{python}
candy_nutrition.loc[:,candy_nutrition.columns.duplicated()].head()
```

The ***tilde*** inverses the True/False values so we can select the opposite values. 

```{python}
~candy_nutrition.columns.duplicated()
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

So, when we select the non-duplicated columns by converting their values from "False" to "True" using the `~` operator: 
```{python}
candy_nutrition_cleaned = candy_nutrition.loc[:,~candy_nutrition.columns.duplicated()]
candy_nutrition_cleaned
```

## Vertical Concatenation

The new dataset `candybars_more.csv` has 3 additional candy bars that we wish to add to the original `candy` dataframe.  The columns in this dataframe have the same order as in the `candy` dataframe. 

```{python}
candy_more = pd.read_csv('candybars_more.csv')
candy_more
```



Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

When we want to vertically combine dataframes (add rows), we use the argument `axis=0` with `pd.concat()`. 

```{python}
large_candybars = pd.concat([candy, candy_more], axis=0)
large_candybars
```


After combining them now have 8 rows and the same 4 columns.  But wait! 
The index column has non-unique values. It may be a good idea to reset this so we use our friend `reset_index()` with the argument `drop=True` to remove the original index:

```{python}
large_candybars_cleaned = large_candybars.reset_index(drop=True)
large_candybars_cleaned

```

## Be careful of order!

 `pd.concat()` is great when our dataframes have the same order for each observation.  What happens if our dataframes have different orders for the candy bars?  Let's use an example with the dataframe`snacksize_candybars.csv`.  This contains the candy bars from `candy`  in a shuffled order. 

```{python}
snacksize_candybars = pd.read_csv('snacksize_candybars.csv')
snacksize_candybars
```

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

What happens when we concatenate `candy` and `snacksize_candybars` now that it has different rows? 

```{python}
pd.concat([candy, snacksize_candybars], axis=1)
```

Oh no.  This does not look good.  You can see that the 2 `name` columns have different values in each row which means this concatenation would produce incorrect results!

<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

### Remember...

The biggest takeaway remark with concatenation is that it works well when we are trying to glue two dataframes together horizontally or vertically where the rows and columns are in the same order.

If your dataframes don't have the same row values, your data will be displayed incorrectly and therefore your results will also have no meaning.
