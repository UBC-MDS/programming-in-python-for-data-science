        "description": "Learn the fundamentals of programming in Python, including how to clean, filter, arrange, aggregate and transform data. You will learn the foundations of programming in Python while writing human-readable code that sets a foundation of best practices and coding style. You will gain the skills to clean, filter, manipulate (wrangle) and summarize data using Python libraries for more effective data analysis. An overview of data structures, iteration, flow control and program design relevant to data exploration and analysis will be addressed along with fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals and data structures that create a solid foundation in data science programming.",
