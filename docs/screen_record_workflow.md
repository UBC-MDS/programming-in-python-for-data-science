# Screen Recording Videos Workflow

## Using Camtasia

## Hayley standard for slides 

- Using my 13" Macbook Pro laptop      
- Dimensions = 1980 * 1020      
- Facetime HD camera = 1280 * 720     
- Broswer = Chrome, with Zoom at 80% taking up the whole screen     
- If using a browser, hide your "favourites" and enter full screen mode.
- Save your file in two ways: 
    - Save it as a .cmproj file by going to File > Save As 
- These can then be put into a dropbox and send to him for editing. 

## Mike's notes

- When you start the recording, there's a menu under the screen capture part. Use that and select 1980x1020.
- Keep in mind you can move that green box.
- For me, I need to make my chrome window smaller so that it looks right at 80% zoom.

## Other Recommendations 
- Use a microphone for the cleanest audio.
- Take up a large amount of head room in your face recording.
- Use a plain background.
- Set up the face recording as far to the right as right as possible.
