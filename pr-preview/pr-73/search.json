Not only does this give us the result quicker, but it also gives us the mean of each column of the dataframe.\nThink of how many filtering and mean calculations would have to be done if we were to do this using our initial approach.\nOf course, using groups is not limited to finding only the mean.

When applied to quantitative data, it groups the values into ranges, and the height of each bar shows the frequency of each range.\nWe can generate a histogram plot of the calories values in the cereal dataframe, which is quantitative. This will enable us to see the various values of calories and how many times they occur.\nTo make a histogram, we use mark_bar().\nIn the encode() verb, we specify the x-axis as calories and use the argument bin=True.
