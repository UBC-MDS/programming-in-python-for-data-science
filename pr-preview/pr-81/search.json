Be patient, it could take a few minutes.\nWhen you see ____ in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run it and see if you obtain the desired output. Submit your code to validate if you were correct.\nMake sure you remove the hash (#) symbol in the coding portions of this question. We have commented them so that the line won’t execute and you can test your code after each step.\nUse the lego dataframe to help answer the next question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s practice using the verbs we learned from the lesson to process a string column in our Lego dataset.\nTasks:\n\nConvert the name column in the lego dataset to lowercase and overwrite the dataframe by saving it as an object named lego.\nFilter the dataset to find all the Lego sets that contain \"weetabix\" in the name column.\nSave this as an object named lego_weetabix.\nReplace the word\"weetabix” in the name column of the lego_wetabix dataframe with the string \"cereal-brand\".\nSave this in an object called lego_cereal.\nIf the row contains the word \"promotional\" in the name column, change the entire value to \"cereal-brand freebie\".\nDisplay lego_cereal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you using .assign() and .lower() to convert the name column to lowercase?\nAre you using str.contains('weetabix') to filter all the rows?\nYou should be using assign() with str.replace('weetabix', 'cereal-brand') to replace “weetabix”.\nYou should be using .loc[] and str.contains('promotional') (and a single =) to assign new row values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFully worked solution:",
